# **Advanced DL Course Final Project: Digital Image Automation**
**Contributors**: Adi Dokhan & Lilac Muhanna

## **Project Overview**
This project explores advanced automated methods for digital image editing, specifically through object detection and removal using deep learning techniques. By leveraging the COCO 2017 dataset and the FiftyOne library, we aim to improve efficiency and accuracy in processing digital images for varied applications, from aesthetic enhancements to privacy protection.

## **Components**
### **Object Detection**
- **Technique Used**: YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
- **Optimization**: Customized for efficient vehicle identification.

### **Object Removal**
- **Technique Used**: Mask R-CNN for precise object segmentation.
- **Post-Processing**: DeepFill GANs employed to naturally reconstruct image areas post-object removal.

## **Highlights**
- **Data Handling**: Automated data preprocessing and conversion from COCO format to YOLO using FiftyOne, focusing exclusively on vehicle-related images.
- **Model Efficiency**: Enhanced YOLOv5's speed and accuracy for object detection; integrated DeepFill GAN for high-fidelity image restoration.
- **User Interface**: Developed an intuitive interface that simplifies the uploading and editing process, enabling users to achieve desired outcomes with minimal effort.

## **Conclusion**
Our project significantly advances the field of automated digital image processing, providing robust tools for object detection and seamless object removal. These improvements not only enhance user experience but also broaden the practical applications of image editing technology.
